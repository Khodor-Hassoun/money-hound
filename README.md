Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React library](https://reactjs.org/). React is a free, open-source JavaScript library. It works best to build user interfaces by combining sections of code (components) into full websites.
- This project uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/). A minimal and flexible [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. 
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)  MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
